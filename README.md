✅ This version now has professional dashboard mockups that make the README portfolio-ready, visually clear, and appealing to recruiters or GitHub visitors.

If you want, I can also create actual image mockups (PNG/JPG) of these dashboards and show how to embed them directly in the README so it looks like a real interactive system preview.

Do you want me to do that next?
